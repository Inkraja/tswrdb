###Preface

All credit of this documentation goes to Jacob Seidelin. His contribution to the TSW community made this much easier to do.
This documentation consists most of his notes, with some additions/corrections/language done by Joakim Bj√∏rnstad.

###Introduction to the Resource DataBase (RDB)

The Resource DataBase format is used in The Secret World (TSW) and Age of Conan (AoC), both titles by Funcom. This documentation is focused on The Secret World, but the general information can probably used with AoC aswell.

The RDB data files can be found in the <TSW game>/RDB folder. The folder structure typically looks like this:

```
<TSW root>/RDB/
|
+---------- 01.rdbdata
+---------- 02.rdbdata
+---------- 03.rdbdata
+---------- ...
+---------- le.idx
+---------- RDBHashIndex.bin
```

The RDB folder contains three interesting types of files:

* ``NN.rdbdata``: Contains all game assets such as art, sound, textures and item data.
* ``le.idx``: The index file. Contains data about how data is arranged in the NN.rdbdata files.
* ``RDBHashIndex``: Presumed to contain the valid files for the current patch version.

The ``.rdbdata`` files are organized like a large disk image, with ``le.idx`` as the index file. It stores index entries, with a reference to a data entry, grouped by RdbType. Each index entry in ``ie.idx`` has a corresponding data entry in one of the ``.rdbdata`` files. The index entries belonging to an RdbType can be spread out on any of the ``.rdbdata`` files.

###RDB Data files (NN.rdbdata)

The format of the data files is simpler. A small 4-byte header with a file signature followed by data and more data. As mentioned earlier, you need to know the start offset of the content file you're after (which you find in the index). 

Each file entry has a 16 byte header before the actual data. This is not taken in account in the data offset, thus to find the header, one needs to look 16 bytes in front of the data offset. This header contains some of the same information as what you find in the index. i.e. RDB Type, RDB Id and data length.

**Note:** Please read about [RDB Id data](#rdb-id-data) before processing the actual data.

**File Structure (NN.rdbdata)**

| File part | Length |
|-----------|--------|
| Header    | 4      |
| Data      | ---    |
 
**Header**

| 16     | DataLength | RDB Id data |

###RDB Id data

The RDB Id data contains data categorized under a given RDB Type. For example, this can be images, audio, 3D models or text collections. Before processing this data, one needs to note that there is a 12 byte RDB Id data header, for each chunk of RDB Id data.

Some RDB Types have RDB Id's with custom headers that extend beyond the 12 byte headers. *In each section that describes a specific RDB Type, this header will be included to avoid confusion*.

**RDB Id data Header**

| Offset | Length | Contents |
|--------|--------|----------|
| 0      | 4      | RDB Type |
| 4      | 4      | RDB Id   |
| 8      | 4      | Unknown  |

###Hash index (RDBHashIndex.bin)

The hash index isn't that interesting unless you need to grab individual files on the server that aren't in the index.

**File Structure (RDBHashIndex.bin)**

| File part | Length        |
|-----------|---------------|
| Header    | 4             |
| Hash Data | NumTypes * x  |
 
**Header**

| Offset | Length | Contents                           |

###Filenames (RdbType 1000010)

The RDB data files doesn't store the original names of the content files so they're only identifiable by their type and id. 

However, RDB type 1000010 contains a single file which is a table of filenames for, among other things, the 3D model files and the textures. The format of this file is really simple, just a list of file id / filename pairs, grouped by RDB type.

**File Structure (1000010)**

| File part                 | Length       |
|---------------------------|--------------|
| [DataHeader](#rdb-id-data)| 12           |
| Header                    | 4            |
| Types                     | NumTypes * x |

**Header**

| 4      | 4              | NumEntries        |
| 8      | NumEntries * x | Filename entries  |

**Filename Entry**

| Offset | Length         | Contents                        |
|--------|----------------|---------------------------------|
| 0      | 4              | RDB Id                          |
| 4      | 4              | FilenameLength                  |
| 8      | FilenameLength | Null-terminated filename string |

###XML data

Several of the data types are stored as XML data. Most of the XML types have a corresponding BXML type which is a binary representation of the XML data. You'll also find such ascii/binary XML pairs in "/data/gui/" in the TSW folder. It appears that the game automatically generates the BXML files from the ASCII versions (in the /data/ folder, that is.)

[Back to overview](#overview)

###Text data (RdbType 1030002)

RDB type 1030002 contains text data collections. Among other things, this is where you'll find all the dialogue text, mission reports, lore, etc. in all the supported languages.

Each file contains a string collection belonging to a certain category. For example, here are all the dialog and mission report strings (converted into a more readable format): http://www.mediafire.com/?hab0pmgcvfbqhqc

The language of the text collection isn't stored in the files, but in "/data/text/" you'll find a *.tdbl file for each language. These files are basically lists of which entries in 1030002 belong to each language.

**File Structure (RDB Type 1030002)**

| File part                 | Length           | Note                    |

###3D models (RdbType 1010001)

The 3D models are the most complex format. I don't recognize the data format and suspect that it is a custom format made by Funcom. There's too much to explain with words, hopefully the specs below are easy enough to understand for someone who knows what to do with the information.

###Textures (RdbType 1010004)

Some of the textures in, for example, RdbType 1010004 are plain PNG files but most are in a custom format, FCTX (Funcom texture?). These appear to be DDS files with a custom header so with a bit of hackery, they can be turned into proper DDS files by removing the FCTX header and adding a DDS header.
