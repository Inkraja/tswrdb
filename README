tswrdb
======

tswrdb is a project that aims to document and extract the contents of rdb data files (.rdbdata), for *fun* and *curiosity*. It is written in Scala.

The project consists of three components:

* The documentation of the file formats
* `tswrdb-api`: the Scala API to extract and post-process rdb data
* `tswrdb-cmdui`: the Scala program that enables users to extract rdb data. It uses `tswrdb-api` client code.

Note: all active development takes place in the `develop` branch. Stable releases are merged into `master`.
